This seemed a lot longer when I planned it in my notebook at lunch.

| GitHub user | project (both sides) | BitBucket user | SCM  | Schedule |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ---- | -------- |
| ocornut     | imgui                | g-pechorin     | None | Periodic |

1. Install [hg-git](http://hg-git.github.io/)
	* You'll have to do this on the Jenkins server
	* You'll have to do it either for the Jenkins user or all
	* I'm using an OsX machine as my host, so I was able to use `easy_install` to install `hg-git` and `dulwich`
1. setup a project on GitHub
1. create a Jenkins **Freestyle project** which runs periodically
	* Polling the SCM was **NOT** an option since there's no `default` branch on GitHub
		* ... this is a quirk of `hg-git` ... I think
		* ... IIRC/YRMV - so sling me a tweet or whatever if I'm wrong
1. program the job to pull from git, push to hg, and ignore results of `1`
	* this was only elaborate because I needed it to not fail when there were no changes
		```
		#!/bin/bash

		if [ -d "imgui" ]; then
			echo "Re-Using ImGUI"
			cd imgui
			hg pull git+ssh://git@github.com:ocornut/imgui.git
		else
			echo "Cloning ImGUI"
			hg clone git+ssh://git@github.com:ocornut/imgui.git
			cd imgui
		fi

		hg push -f ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/g-pechorin/imgui

		retcode=$?

		if [ $retcode -eq 0 ] || [ $retcode -eq 1 ]; then
			exit 0
		else
			exit $retcode
		fi
		```
