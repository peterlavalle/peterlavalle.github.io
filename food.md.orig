I eat a lot of prepared food - I'm lazy.

I try to follow a restrictive/gym diet - I'm vain.

So I started keeping pictures of the things I ate - I'm meticulous.

# Desk Meals

# Batchelor's Chicken and Mushroom

surprisingly good.
it's not as salty as I was dreading; still a bit saltier than I should be having I expect.
needed stirring to actually mix but it turned into real looking food.

## Naked Hoisin Noodles

bad.
tastes like salt and flour cooked to a disappointing conclusion.
just get mug shots.

## Spicy Curry Noodles / Tesco Value (Hearty Food Co) 

dull and salty.
not sure why it was so bad - but i'll choose something else next time.

# Energy Drinks

## Percol - Protein Latte

this is like god-damn candy to me.
if the label is right; it's good as whole milk in terms of protein.
it's my new post-workout drink!

... or would be if the B&M next to my gym still stocked it.

# Protein Bars

## Grenade - Cookies and Cream

light and crunchy.
tasty too.
pricey, but, all this is what I'd expect from the brand.

## Warrior

tastes fine - not at all goopy which was nice change from "flapjack" expectations.
looks like a charity/fundraiser/cacoa is just as good thing, but, tasted like a real snack.
