# Paints

![pots](/img/imperium-paints.jpg)

I have ... a thing ... for paints.
There are 25x12ml pots, 2x18ml pots and 4x24ml pots in the picture from the poster.
Most came off of (or out of) [this thread on FaceBook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WarhammerConquest/posts/821459108560739/).

So far 9x12ml and 1x24ml pots have been confirmed in upcoming issues.
Another 7x12ml and 2x18ml are obvious from the pictures - assuming no "new" paints are created during the magazine's run.[^warCry]
This leaves 3x24ml (which are kind of obvious) and another 9x12ml paint to guess at - but three of the 12ml pots look kind of obvious.

[^warCry]:
	Some of the WarCry starter set's terrain was shown and released in The Mortal Realms magazine before it had been announced.

### Issue 06 - Primaris Aggressors + Paint

These are the first "normal" models that aren't in a starter!
You can build these with flamers (which auto-hit) or bolters (which go 50% farther) and a grenade launcher.
One of them can be a sergeant, or, they can all be "dudes."

- {{<fbplan 336842-warhammer-40k-imperium-6>}}
- {{<wah40k space-marines Aggressor-Squad>}}
- {{<retail space-marines-primaris-aggressors "games-workshop/warhammer-40k/blood-angels/space-marines-primaris-aggressors">}}

### Issue 08 - (Blister) Necron Overlord

This will be my first "new" Necron model from the set ... other than [the Necron Warriors Three](#issue-02-necron-warriors-three-paint) (I have Indomitus already)

- {{<fbplan 336840-warhammer-40k-imperium-8>}}
- {{<wah40k necrons Overlord>}}
- {{<retail necron-overlord "games-workshop/warhammer-40k/necrons/necron-overlord">}}
	- There's another sculpt in the medium Elite starter[^outElite] and the large Command starter[^outCommand]
- {{<lex40k Necron_Overlord>}}

### Issue 09 - Necron Warriors (1 of 2)

There will be two sets of these, with two issues each.

- [Magazine - 09]({{<fbplanet 336839-warhammer-40k-imperium-9>}})
- [Magazine - 10]({{<fbplanet 336838-warhammer-40k-imperium-10>}})
- [Magazine - 28]({{<fbplanet 344858-warhammer-40k-imperium-28>}})
- [Magazine - 29]({{<fbplanet 344859-warhammer-40k-imperium-29>}})
- Warriors {{<wah40k necrons Necron-Warriors>}}
	- there are the three alt sculpts in the {{<product paint-40k9-necron>}}
- Scarabs {{<wah40k necrons Canoptek-Scarab-Swarms>}}
- {{<retail necrons-warriors "games-workshop/warhammer-40k/necrons/necrons-necron-warriors">}}
- Lore
	- Warriors {{<lex40k Necron_Warrior>}}
	- Scarabs {{<lex40k Scarab>}}
	- Gauss Flayer {{<lex40k Gauss_Flayer>}}
	- Gauss Reaper {{<lex40k Gauss_Reaper>}}

These issues are each half of the retail boxed set which is in the small[^outRecruit], medium[^outElite] and large[^outCommand] starters as well.
There are [two sets of these in the contents listing photo - there are six scarab swarms for sure.](https://www.warhammer40000imperium.com/wp-content/themes/warhammer40000imperium/im/UK-home-intro-army.png)
You can build these Necron Warriors with either the **"Gauss Flayer" (rifle)** or the **"Gauss Reaper" (shotgun)** ... unlike the previous models.

The (totally made up) rumour is that the Canoptek Scarabs ( {{<lex40k Scarab>}}) (as well as Tyranid Ripper Swarms ({{<lex40k Ripper>}}), Tau Drones ({{<lex40k Drone>}}) and others) came as "pets" because the original kits were made during Pokemania.


Each issue should have;

- 5x Necron Warriors and 1 or 2 Scarab Swams (There will be 10x Warriors and 3x Swarms across both issues)
	- standalone set {{<retail necrons-warriors "games-workshop/warhammer-40k/necrons/necrons-necron-warriors">}}
	- you're only saving £2.80 compared to the small Recruit starter[^outRecruit]
	- The same sprue is also in the small Recruit starter[^outRecruit], the medium Elite starter[^outElite] and the large Command starter[^outCommand] sets.

### Issue 10 - Necron Warriors (2 of 2)

### Issue 11 - Librarian in Phobos Armour

- {{<fbplan 338703-warhammer-40k-imperium-11>}}
- {{<wah40k space-marines Librarian-in-Phobos-Armour>}}
- {{<retail primaris-librarian-in-phobos-armour "games-workshop/warhammer-40k/space-marines/primaris-librarian-in-phobos-armour">}}
	- I *might* use this to make a "Tome Keeper's Combat Patrol" with;
		- [Heroes of the Chapter]({{< outpost space-marine-heroes-of-the-chapter >}})
			<!-- - {{<retail space-marine-heroes-of-the-chapter "search?q=Heroes+of+the+Chapter">}} -->
			- seems to be out of print at this point
		- Primaris Repulsor {{<retail space-marines-primaris-repulsor "games-workshop/warhammer-40k/blood-angels/space-marines-primaris-repulsor">}}

### Issue 12 - Paints

Another paint issue, but, with some interesting paint colours that should calm the groknards.

- {{<fbplan 338702-warhammer-40k-imperium-12>}}
- Shade / Agrax Earthshade
	- it comes in a (matt) 24ml pot {{<retail citadel-shade-agrax-earthshade-24ml "wargames-and-miniatures-by-manufacturer/games-workshop/citadel-games-workshop-paints/agrax-earthshade-24ml-">}}

	- This paint is a brown "wash" or "shade" and is almost as widely beloved as Nuln Oil {{<retail citadel-shade-nuln-oil-24ml "wargames-and-miniatures-by-manufacturer/games-workshop/citadel-games-workshop-paints/nuln-oil-24ml-">}}
		- ... which also comes as Nuln Oil Gloss {{<retail nuln-oil-gloss-24ml "wargames-and-miniatures-by-manufacturer/games-workshop/citadel-games-workshop-paints/nuln-oil-gloss-24ml">}}
	- This same (matt) paint is avaialable in all but one of the 40k and AoS paint sets.
		- ... it's in the {{<product paint-40k9-inter>}}
		- ... it's in the {{<product paint-40k9-tools>}}
		- ... it's in the {{<product paint-aos3-tools>}}
		- ... it's in the {{<product paint-aos3-orruks>}}
		- ... it's in the {{<product paint-aos3-storm>}}
	- ... but, the {{<product paint-40k9-necron>}} includes the Gloss paint instead
- Base / Screamer Pink
	- it comes in a pot[^pottle] {{<retail citadel-base-screamer-pink "games-workshop/citadel-games-workshop-paints/citadel-base/citadel-base-screamer-pink">}}
	- This isn't in any of the other sets. I'm surprised it's in the magazine.
- Layer / Canoptek Alloy
	- it comes in an 12ml pot {{<retail layer-canoptek-alloy"wargames-and-miniatures-by-manufacturer/games-workshop/citadel-games-workshop-paints/layer-canoptek-alloy-12ml-6-pack-">}}
	- This is a *new* paint introduced in 9th - very exciting.

### Issue 13 - Space Marine Assault Intercessors

- {{<fbplan 338701-warhammer-40k-imperium-13>}}
- {{<wah40k space-marines Assault-Intercessor-Squad>}}
- This sprue is ONLY in the small Recruit starter[^outRecruit], the medium Elite starter[^outElite] and the large Command starter[^outCommand] sets.
- The sergeant can be assembled as a mook - so you can use these to fatten up an existing squad
- The sergeant can be assembled with a Heavy Bolt Pistol ({{<lex40k "Bolt_pistol#Heavy_Bolt_Pistol">}}) or a Plasma Pistol ({{<lex40k Plasma_pistol>}})
	- There are specific head/helmet/sword bits for each
- Assault Intercessor {{<lex40k "Intercessor_Squad#Assault_Intercessor">}}

If you want to go crazy the retail kit ({{<retail space-marine-assault-intercessors "games-workshop/warhammer-40k/space-marines/space-marines-assault-intercessors">}}) has two identical sprues to make a squad with.
You could get one of those "full" kits, build them as two 5-man squads, and then use this sprue to fatten up that squad.

When I was assembling these myself, I dropped the first helmet.
I used the sergeant's mook-helmet as a replacement - the helmet "mounts" might be interchangeable.

The full retail box contains everything needed to make either ten Skitarii Rangers or ten Skitarii Vanguard with a champion and specials.
This is (once again) spread across non-duplicated sprues, so, keep an eye on what you get to avoid the "all left hands" thing that happened with the Necron Warriors.
(Hachette was fine with this one AFAIK ... so ... I guess that old mistake was a once-off)

# Delivered from FP

I started ordering these (en masse) from Forbidden Planet since the smaller packets should fit into my mailbox ... and are sturdier as well.

## Speculation; 41 - 60

)

Based on the photo, we can make some guesses about the contents in 41 - 60.
The units depicted could be spread across 12 issues, leaving 8 for terrain and paint.
Since 1:4 issues seem to be "paint" that leaves 3 terrain issues ... which seems pretty believable for another building and some pipes.

## Issue 61 - 80

Unknown, but, we're likely getting what's below.
Odd (and notable) Honoured of the Chapter isn't present.
