## pureGen

- this is great
- coming at it from this direction; great

## iva paper

# 2020-05-22

## purebind

- while poking around the papaer i felt that i was "fighting they system" with the/my generator startegy
- i'd like to breify explore code generation

### scala

these look reasonable, but, are't the "front end" that i want

the use of macros is particularly interesting

### purescript

- quick google seems to indicate it's "obscure" enough that poeple point at compiler internals

## ukri

- i'm EPSRC! i can submit?
	- ... unlikely; there are new sections
- i've submitted it'bleurg

## rack

- i pulled the thing apart, cleaned the hot end, it printed a normal tool holder fine
- i've started another rack ... it's doing a few clicks ...


## iva paper

### what did M say?

moved to its own file



# 2020-05-20

## rack

- final "normal" section is printing and should be done at 5AM
- i gave up; too much sacry clikcing

- pulled apart the printer and that didn't help
- actually; it's worse
- the clickling is the problem; i belive that it's "backpressure"
- i'd like to pull the thing apart again

## blog

- started a writeup of the muzzle burn i had; should have finished it .. but ... PRESSURE!

## depa

- tried to rewrite/monadize the/my "tripple thread" idea


## Loft

- need to check with the seller if they did the Loft or if The Loft was there when they bought it

- rob's advice was to check with the "planning office"
- NG7 7NR / New Basford

- https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects/36/loft_conversion
- scribbled through trying to see what's what
- looks like £206 for planning permission ... maybe £266?

## UKRI

- sent the email to see whomst my funding group is
- rock on; https://nottingham.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/covid-impact-statement-ukri-pgrs-with-funding-ending-13

## yost

- should do authentication
	- https://scalatra.org/guides/2.7/http/authentication.html
- ooh;scentry looks like it could replace my current approach .. hmm

- okay, so i want to
	1. if no users; setup db
	2. if users; require login
	3. if logged in; continue as normal
- need to delay this

# 2020-05-19

## extension

- i have the form ... i think
	- need to double check whom my funding body is
- i need to send it somewhere ... not sure where yet

## supervision

- 2020-01-31 is incomplete
	- needs super comments
	- needs my comments
- 2020-03-13 is incomplete
	- needs super comments

# 2020-05-18

## yost

- added the user database and query "stufff"
- i have ideas of what to do next, but ... it's good for now-now and shows progress
	- oh and nom the host brainch's "form" monads - those rock

## rack

- the "rest of" the rack fiunished last night
- there's a lot of "stringing" and it's worrying me
- setup the first "full" rack to print; want to wait until after the washer has run

## extension

i think that the "proper" email(s) including the form are/were what I foudn yesterday


### justification / form




- not doing great; had personal problems (holiday illness, eviction, mental health) at the beginning of the year while preparing for second-year review and (a house purchase)
    - was advised "taking a break" would be difficult to justify, and that there was no "sick pay" so I'd have a nightmare passing credit checks.
        - I'm now aware that neither of these details is true

- most of the sources of stress are personal, but, there are some professional ones as well

- to deal with the psychological stress/s
    - I have "relaxed" my diet; I end up spending more time cooking and cleaning than I normally would
        - I normally try to eat very frugally and save money for social and recreation expenses ... oddly switching to more home-cooking hasn't had the financial impact I was afraid that it would
    - I'm avoiding "going outside" as much as possible; this limits my fear of contracting the disease
        - this is in line with the NHS suggestions for anyone with a suppressed immune system
        - I've demonstrated no (prevalent) symptoms of the disease (i coughed when vacuuming, had a headache or two, etc) so am not "self-isolating"
    - I've been avoiding situations which I expect will put me into contact with other people
        - ... specifically; (until I can get on a delivery list) I'm using the larger grocery store to avoid the queues and crowds who seem persistent in my local shop


#### describe impact
##### impact on you

- I was not in a situation to "absorb" this, I was a bit "in the red" but "manageable" when the lockdown started
- the transition to "work from home" has not been smooth
- I have an adult ASD diagnosis and a childhood ADHD diagnosis
- - the change to working in my living room, and, the constant distractions from the neighbours, my appliances and pressure of household chores are on my mind always
- I'm currently taking medication for anxiety and depression; isolation and the threat of a pandemic are challenging to "just ignore"
- - again; recent events have meant that I'm waking throughout the night and not sleeping
- I'm also taking immune-suppressants for my eczema
- - getting the monthly refills seems to require multiple trips to the pharmacy during the week when I've out of pills

##### impact on your research        

- the next stage of my work should have been to sit down with peers and run a sort of "workshop" to assess the viability of the techniques that I'm researching
- - this may be possible, but, faces the hurdle of needing to "remote support" whatever issues they have

#### actions taken to minimise the impact
##### actions taken to minimise the impact

- focussed my attention on "development" areas of my research that don't require human presence
- to deal with the psychological stress/s
- I have "relaxed" my diet; I end up spending more time cooking and cleaning than I normally would
- - I normally eat frugally and quickly; the home cooking seems to be a relif to take the time and "do" again
- I'm avoiding "going outside" as much as possible; this limits my fear of contracting the disease
- - this is in line with the NHS suggestions for anyone with a suppressed immune system
- I've been avoiding situations which I expect will put me into contact with other people
- - ... specifically; (until I can get on a delivery list) I'm using the larger grocery store to avoid the queues and crowds who seem persistent in my local shop
- twice weekly calls with one of my supervisors
- engaging in regular "lunch meetings" with my research group


##### aspects of research that are unimpacted

- submitted a conference paper fine. will have another chance to revise it as the deadlines are being extended.
- focussed my attention on "development" areas of my research that don't require human presence
- being "more prepared" for an eventual continuation of previous options


#### next steps

- adapt my "software prototype" to work on "general purpose" PC so that I can perform the study remotely
- refine existing papers, and explore other (less human-centric) methods to demonstrate the research goals

#### evidence

- i believe that my ASD diagnosis is on record with the university
- i can display the/my prescriptions to support the anxiety/depression
- the ADHD was diagnosed in the USA (as ADD) so I have no evidence to support that
- i can send in copies of the research paper that has been submitted


## council tax !

- need to redoop the rest of the form

## usa tax !

- need to finish

## the loft !

- checkl rob et al and contact council

## boof video?

- what about tool to;
	1. use ffmpeg to extract frame-then-frame from a video
	2. run some boof-cv on the frame(s)
	3. re-encode the processed frames as video
	4. use the original video to dub the processed one

## ? hexo dates

- can i get dates on the/my blog posts?

### blog post

- https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/researchexchange/2020/05/07/27225/?dm_t=0,0,0,0,0&dm_i=5IL5,18S1,207QS,4IXE,1
	- up to six months, but, considered on a case by case basis
	- should have gone to the town hall ... but was it recorded?

### discussion

https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/thread/6575327917327335424/


I'm not great-great; I feel like I was already "in the red" when the lockdown started and the stress/change of working from home hasn't helped. I think that I'm "getting better" - I just worry that the damage is done to progress and that I'll be unable to produce a meaningful thesis. There's an extension to the studies option that I'm hoping will be granted so ... that's a chance I guess.

29th (not 20th)

use a form to record what my expoerinces are/have been over closure period


14:50
	- extension needs to be  COVID19 related
	- such as long term health problems exacerbated by it

2100
	- more stuff about things on the forms

1:02:00
	- discussion of mental health concerns

overall i feel a sense of "imposter syndrome"

i should have decleared a healthe problem earlier

### justification

- not doing great; had personal problems (holiday illness, eviction, mental healt) at beginning of year while preparing for second year review and (a house purcahse)
	- was advidsed "taking a break" would be difficult to justify, and that there was no "sick pay" so i'd have a nightmare passing credit checks.
		- i'm now aware that niether of these details are true
- i was not in a situation to "absorb" this

## rack

i worked more on the rack - not too much more
i've got a desiogn that's not ideal, but, doesn't raise concerns
i'm printkning a 3x1 test now and have a 4x5 with cooresponding space missing ready to go on a separate card if/when i'm happy with the first one

	- scaled by 85%
	- rotated and translated
	- lloks like it's print ... but ... the horns will need support
		- couldn't they have done side-horns that printered verical and just stick on?

# 2020-05-10

- iva iva iva

- need
	- [x] merge 6&7 to "proposed approach"
	- [x] remove section 8??
	- [x] write an abstract
	- [x] write a conclusion
	- [X] "deal with" introduction
	- [X] remove "draft" watermarks
		- this looks tied to that .cls file
		- nope! just changing the document's class thing
	- [x] correct "publication" notes in the header/footer
	- [x] set correct keywords

functional programming
agent architectures
virtual humans
interoperability

	- [X] submit what i have 
- want
	- [ ] do math of function application
	- [ ] tweak figure sizes; the FPR:SF instances are a bit hard to read
	- [ ] edit text of footnore about real-time or "offline"

- soon
	- [ ] record "signal free module code" (like timestamps) as a need in nihn
		- or maybe not; if the compoent needs a timestamp and the simulation doesn't open one they can suckit?
			- ... well ... they will get a startup-error
		- hey; is "signals in DePa" just stporing "() => T" instead of "T => ()"
			- ... like ... that'd work, right?
			- ... and execution can queue up the invocations for the end as a chain of runnables ...

```scala
def >>>(this: Runnable, next: Runnable) : Runnable =
	new Runnable {
		this.run()
		next.run()
	}

# 2020-05-09


## iva

- iva is the goal. getting iva done is the goal.
- really feeling beatup by the late nights; better food has helped.

- no incoming messages

- don't see "marddown" listed as an accepted ACM package ... but ... I doubt the'd notice


- [x] re-state section 2-b (related work)
- [ ] gratch2002 integration (likley as part of the problem statement)
- [ ] re-state section 3-b
- [ ] re-draft/state section 5
- [ ] abstract
- [ ] work out what to do with the introduction
- drop 7 (how to prove it) and 8 (use case)
- remove the "unpublished draft" text from the template
- [ ] teaser image for paper

- markdown in Overleaf works!

# 2020-05-08


- found `phox-demo` branch yesterday; i want `purebind` to be done ibefore the trials but ... the `phox-demo` might become and adjsuted variant that i work weith anyway
	- my headche with `purebind` is that the "kernel" (FLoaBT) and the "headers" seem to be tighly coupled which feels like a bad smell


IVA paper continues slowly; not good considering deadlines.
I was enthusiastic about continuing the continued literature review, but, hadn't considered that I might need to adjust the template.


Yost continues to be obstructed by;

- my incomplete Mina-SSHd implementation
- the poor lack of time/focus for the database setup


The WonderToy still needs "just work" to progress to something that can encode and decode objects.
The same can be said of the "erudite" cluster.


Host tool has yielded an interesting monadic-html-form reminiscent of an immediate-mode GUI.


As a 13th project; I'd like to plan a workshop with "whomever" to evaluatie the IAI kit I've developed
