      <description>I setup JupyterLab within a [uv]() project &amp;hellip; it worked just fine &amp;hellip;
Did Python win the language wars because the tooling is easy to use?
λ uv init λ uv add jupyterlab λ uv run jupyter lab  That works and runs locally. It&amp;rsquo;s fine.
What&amp;rsquo;s even better?
The Codium/Code extensions to just run/use .ipynb files in your editor.
So.
So &amp;hellip; in editor this seems like a nice thing.</description>

      <title>Git Copy PY Script</title>

      <description>I found a set of git tasks was taking non-trivial time to checkout and push between repositories. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find docs for a (working) git command sequence1 that pushed branches from one remote to another; so I wrote a python script to checkout a branch to local then push it. Once I was sure that it was running; I could reallocate my attention to something more deserving of my talents.</description>
