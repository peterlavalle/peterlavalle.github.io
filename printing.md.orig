This is a rough (and uneditied) log of my 3D printing attempts.
I'm posting it mainly as I see no harm in that, rather than a believe that my poorly written scribbling with be of greate sorcial benefit.

(The spelling mistakes above are as intentional here as they are in 419 scams)

# ey.19.bsg-little-cottage.115.roof-v2


i gave the plate a quick wipe, and, it felt taky so i skipped glue/clean and just levelled the bed

## results (attempt 1)

it adhered, but, around layer2 i realised "make overhang printable" was enabled which filled the underhang wasting material and time

## results (attempt 2)

|part|overhang|scale|layer|time|MASS|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|v2 roof | yes | 115% | 0.12 | 1 day 18 hours 35 minutes | 182g |
|v2 roof | overhang | 115% | 0.12 | 1 day 23 hours 15 minutes | 135g |


looks like the overhand shouldn't have been on ... but ... WtELF is with that time!?

... oh - and - the extruder was clogged.
i came back in and noticed the print had gotten stuck.

## results (attempt 3)

same `.stl` as 2 - but - i cleaned out the hot-end and switched to a new nozzle (on 2021-08-19)

... so ... le'ts see ...


[... also the upgrade video for couplers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn5g8Qf4h8o)


# ey.18.bsg-little-cottage.115.base-no-inside

this will be "Black Scroll Games" model [Little Cottage (TabletopRPG house)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3621726) 

... well ... it'll be the "roof" part anyway ...

there are variations for this mode, but, i only want the simplest one


i'm assesing which guts i want

i will scale them to 115% (as suggested) for 32mm games


my printer is set to 0.12 which is a finer LOD than the author suggests

|part|scale|layer|time|MASS|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|scalabvle mergedd|100%|0.12|1 day 6 hours 17 minutes | 115g|
|no inside|100%|0.12|22 hours 12 minutes | 87g |
|merged v2 | 100%|0.12|2 days 9 hours 12 minutes | 257g |
|v2 roof | 100% | 0.12 | 1 day 6 hours 52 minutes | 126g |
|v2 roof | 100% | 0.2 | 22 hours 14 minutes | 136g |
|v2 roof | 115% | 0.12 | 1 day 18 hours 35 minutes | 182g |
|no inside|115%|0.12|1 day 4 hours 7 minutes | 114g |


i'll use the no-inside at 0.12 and 115%

i am worried about running out of filament, so, that's the "straw" in not doing the one with interiror

ey.18.bsg-little-cottage.115.base-no-inside

i've set it going around 10pm on Monday night

## results
it was done on Tuesday night (late)

it is mostly-perfect; the support teeth at the top are a bit naff, but, that's hardly an issue



# ey.17.tabletop-plant

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4070264

- as 16 otherwise
- level with a piece of paper
- bed at 60
- nozzle at 200
- i'm using a brin with a 1mm distance and 4mm width

## results

yeah - this one came out great

brilliant

i'm keeping these settings

still want the fancy tool (someday)

# ey.16.5-25-1-move-tray

copying advice (deleted) from reddit.

gonna do hotter nozzle, and, .38 first layer

- nozzle 210
- bed 65
- skirt 1mm
- layer1 thick .38
- layer1 flow 90%
- level with recipt

worked ebter, but, there's a weird separation between layer1 and layer2

print is usable - but - i want to change the design

Advice Was;

- : a deleted comment advocating thicker "layer1" was AMAZING but successive layers didn't come out as well
- ; level with printer paper not recipt
  - contradicts earlier advice, but, the problem is still here (am applying it)
- ! don't print super-hot
	- contradicts earlier advice, but, the problem is still here (i might ignore)
- ? maybe another filament?
	- tempting to switch from the [ey]() once it's spent; eSun does a 3kg pack that's cheaper per unit
- ! don't use a gluestick that's why your prints (without gluestick) aren't sticking
	- again; this is contradictory
- ; use an car tool thing to level the bed
	- ahh; a precise replacement for the paper - yes



# ey.15.5-25-1-move-tray

should be a movement tray, but, am using a high accuracy thing and pritt stick for my sanity

looking at previous settings;
- build plate was way up
- print speed was 45 not 50
- print temp was normal
- tree supports and brim/skirt were things

| quality | time | cost |
|---|---|---|
| super (stock)| 3 hours 2 minutes | 13g |
| dynamic (stock) | 2 hours 16 minutes | 14g |
| standard (stock) | 1 hour 47 minutes | 13g |


i went for Super with *just* 65 plate - i'll use pritt

> ...

and it failed

horribly

looks like the print peeled away and the nozzle "cocooned"

## experiment

I'm posting the below on FaceBook and reddit to see which one gives useful advice.

```markdown
I've been trying to get back into this since ... June?
I haven't had a serious print that's adhered to the build plate ... which is unusual ...

I'm;

* levelling with a receipt
* washing with methylated spirits
* printing on glass
* putting the bed temperature at 65
* (now) using a pritt - brand glue stick\* as the hairspray wasn't working

The print peeled away from the bed during the first layer.
The nozzle isn't clogged
Anyone got any advice?

(\* yes, yes; I'm aware that using adhesives is "uncool" and I should use a glass bed instead. But. I'm doing that ... the glue stick can't hurt adhesion, right?)
```
