Have I mentioned that I own a Pi3?
Well ... this is how I use the Pi3 as an OpenVPN server to remotely work on my home network.
This (anecdotal) post comprises

* a background summary of what OpenVPN does
* details of how I ran-the-script
* notes on what I had to do to connect
* speculation on when I'd want this

## Background

Virtual Private Networks (hereafter VPNs) refer to a client-server system where a client uses an existing network to route all of its traffic through a server.
The advantage is that, if the client is in an insecure location (Bar!) they can access resources (build servers!) that no sane person would expose to the public internet.

Also; if the client is in a country with draconian laws, (or a poor NetFlix catalog) but the server is in a more enlightened region; the setup allows someone to masquerade as being in the other location.

My chief interest is in being able to access BitBucket/Jenkins/GitLab/GitHub/Kallithea et al when I'm in a coffee shop.
There's a mountain of tweaks and voodoo that you can setup as well for this - but it's beyond my interest in this case.

## VPN on the Pi3

I have a Raspberry Pi3 with Jesse-Lite installed - so [I was all set for these instructions.](http://www.pivpn.io/)

> `curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash`[^noJustRun]

[^noJustRun]:
    I didn't actually *just* run a script fromt he interent.
    That'd be stupid.
    In the real world, you should never ever run a script from the internet without checking it.

The script worked as described, my only deviation was sending the traffic through TCP port 443.
I'm trying to use this in cafes with restrictive internet - so I need to fake being a webpage.[^thatsOkayRight]

There was a long period of generating my 2k keys; don't use 4k keys since it takes forever.
I also don't understand "upstream provider" so I chose Google - seems to all work fine now.

[^thatsOkayRight]:
    I don't actually *know* what I'm doing.
    I want this running over/across the `https://` ports to try and trick snoopy routers.
    UDP didn't work - so I used TCP ... right?



Following the setup of the server software, I logged into my (podunk) router and directed the FireWall to assign port 443 to my Pi3, and to use a static IP for the Pi3.
Pretty standard router stuff which never follows a standard UI - so I'm not posting mine here.

## VPN Client on my Ubuntu laptop

I have a (pokey) Ubuntu-Mate laptop; go me!
On my Pi3 - I used the new `pivpn add` command to create a new VPN ... account?
This popped out a single config file - very nice - which I copied to my laptop.
Installing the OpenVPN Client software was a matter of `sudo apt-get install openvpn` to get it.
The final step was to actually connect.
Based on [this StackOverflow post](http://askubuntu.com/questions/508250/openvpn-gui-client-for-udp-tcp#508296) the command is ``sudo openvpn --config ~/ovpn/ppeters-shiny-pi3-vpn.ovpn` with **`~/ovpn/ppeters-shiny-pi3-vpn.ovpn`** being the path to the config file which I copied to my laptop.
I was able to test this by accessing my Jenkins server after tethering my laptop to my cellular phone, but your local Wetherspoon's would be a better place to check.

## VPN Client on my Windows laptop

Client; https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui

I've noticed a lot of public WiFi networks muck around with `http://` traffic ... likely to insert their own adds.
Not sure if this is legal ... so let's see if I can get around it with my VPN!

On my Pi3 - I used the new `pivpn add` command to create a new VPN ... account?
This popped out a single config file - very nice - which I copied to my laptop.

I used the official OpenVPN Client.
I added the `.ovpn` config file to `$(HOME)/OpenVPN/config/` and was able to connect and view my own servers fine.

YaY! ... but ... I need to do something to see hosts outside of my home network.
(Like Google ... or this website)
seems to match this problem https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?t=23261

... just rebooted my home-server and it didn't like it ...


## Do Again

If you're from a dystopian future - [I've dumped a copy of the setup script to accompany this post.](/raw/install.pivpn.io)
If I find myself in a small group with a need for a VPN again - I'd advocate this approach; the £35 Pi3 with a £10 microSD is a very quick solution for this work.
There are probably other roles that a Pi server can fulfill for a small shop that needs their tools to be on-site.

Anyway ... [Happy Birthday to me](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=albert+einstein+birthday) I guess ...
