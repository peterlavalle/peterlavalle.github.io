# Pi3 DynDNS

I want to give my home's Raspberry Pi3 a DNS name so that I can access it more easily.

## DNS and Dynamic IP Addresses

The [Domain Naming System][wikiDNS] is how those readable textual names like `example.com` become the actual [IP Addresses][wikiIPAddress] like `127.0.0.1` that web pages, email, and everything else needs to work.
Various groups allow people to register a domain (or subdomain) and specify the IP address of a computer that the domain should reffer to.
Most home computers, however, don't keep the same IP address forever - they're consideded *dynamic* (rather than *static*) because they can (and do) change.

## DynDNS for Pi3

I'm following the instructions from this guy's page http://blog.mivia.dk/free-dynamic-dns-for-raspberry-pi/ with some changes.

1. I setup an account with the [DNSdynamic](http://www.dnsdynamic.org/) and registed a domain
1. I used apt to `sudo apt-get install ddclient` and get the client on my Pi3
	1. I may have run through the wizzard ; I can't remember
1. I overwrote with the example `/etc/ddclient.conf`

	```
	# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
	#
	# /etc/ddclient.conf

	daemon=300                       # check every 60 seconds
	syslog=yes                       # log update msgs to syslog
	mail=root                        # mail all msgs to root
	mail-failure=root                # mail failed update msgs to root
	pid=/var/run/ddclient.pid        # record PID in file.
	ssl=yes                          # use ssl-support.
	use=web, web=myip.dnsdynamic.org # get ip from server.
	server=www.dnsdynamic.org        # default server
	login=YOUR-LOGIN                 # your login
	password=YOUR-PASSWORD           # your password
	server=www.dnsdynamic.org,       \
	protocol=dyndns2                 \
	YOUR-DOMAIN
	```

... which has the big deviation from the original.

I'm using `myip.dnsdynamic.org` not `myip.dnsdynamic.com` to detect what my IPAddress is.
So that's that - I can host whatnot from my flat.
