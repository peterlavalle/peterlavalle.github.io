This is a rough (and uneditied) log of my 3D printing attempts.
I'm posting it mainly as I see no harm in that, rather than a believe that my poorly written scribbling with be of greate sorcial benefit.

(The spelling mistakes above and below should be considered as intentional here as they are in 419 scams)

# [Eryone - 3](https://amzn.to/3vETX8s)

... which is now a silver colour ...


## ey.74.haggle-barracks-main.3d14h7m.313g (current)

- brim wide to 0.2mm (was 0.1)
- brim wall to 3.5mm (was 4.5)
- initial layer flow to 80% (was 85%)
- nozzle to 190/195/190 (was 200)

no adhesion at first try



### ey.74-1

- nozzle to 200/195/190
- bed looks level
- hairspray after bed heated

failed with peeling

... 

tightebned screws near me a notch and GENTLY waxed with glue stick

failed because of ... ???

### ey.74-2.haggle-barracks-main.314g.3d14h9m

went back to ey.72

... hey ; i should re-numvber these?

#### 1

first printing spagetti'ed

#### 2

cleared spagetti and poked all build plat screws up a single notch

spagetti again!!

#### 3

cleared and gave a gentle wipe

trying with no hairspray this time

(i switched brands/styles - maybe the first one was lucky and this one is not?)

failed to adhere again

### ey.74-3.haggle-barracks-main

brim distance to 0.2

build plate to 75 on layer1 and 65 thereafter

initial fan speed 20%

initial layer thic,mness 0.32

#### 1

worked for awhile, but, heat-clogged then peeled

#### 2 

- regular fan speed at layer 6 (was 4)
- starting fan speed 25 (was 20)
- build plate 75 then 70 (was 75 then 60)

i'm hoping to alleviate the "swole filament" i'm seeing with the cooling
i think that leaving my (glass) plate hot longer should help adhesion

brim seemed to go down fine

heat-clogged

#### 3

- starting fan speed up to 50
- regular fan speed at layer 3

## ey.73.haggle-barracks-main.3d14h9m.314g (failed and resliced)

same settings as before - just with more prayers and no hairspray

....

failed once via peeling

...

failed again via nozzle clog



## ey.72.haggle-barracks-roof.17h58m.61g (current)

based on fb-feedback;

- 70c layer 0 bed
- brin distance ot 0.1
- brim width 4.5
- ~ 0.2mm level
- hairspray
- alchol cleaning
- 0.206? level

17h58m for roof

3d14h7m for full barracks

i'm printing the roof next

543g at start

...

i checked "midway" and ... the changes seem good!

... but - i'm out of hairspray



## ey.71.tower-base-supports.2d9h0m.205g (actual 211g including failure)

spool weighed 754g at start

i've had supports enabled this whole time ... oops

i adjusted the brim to be at 0.3mm instead of 0.6mm

i *really* want to turn down the bed heat, but, elephants won't matter on this print

i want a "sloped ironing" setting, but, that's not an option

... actually; the last time i printed this i DID use ironing AND the printer had a heat clog afterwards. time/heat-creep are the issues with ironign PLA, right?

...

had a peeling failure

restarted - peeling again

i'm going to post on fb and reddit ... i wonder how long it'll take before someone says the gluestick is damaging adhesion

https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/swdte7/warm_or_cool_for_later_adhesion/

https://www.facebook.com/groups/Ender3dp/posts/886441525497517/

```
warm bed or cool bed for continued adhesion?

after my first few layers ... my prints peel off the Ender3 glass bed.
i'm using glue-stick, and a thick first layer; skipping either fails adhesion at the start.
later in the print (before layer 10ish) the print will peel back from the build plate.
i'm levelling with a 0.254mm spacer - i tried 0.356mm and the first layer didn't stick, and, 0.102mm and the nozzle got backed up enough for a heat-creep.

the bed is on 60 all the way through.
so ... should it be lower on later layers to avoid peeling?
```

...

hmm ... hmm ... there was more peeling on the back

## ey.70.mollog-cover.12h56m.65g (actual 59g)

813g

did a backslash

leveled the bed to be buzzing on the knife-ruler

leveled before and after waxing the base

...

there was a single warped corner

the result doesn't fit smoothly; is that because of the rotation and some dimensional inaccuracy?

result is acceptable

had 754g at end

## ey.69.mollog-holder.1d2h44m.126g (actual 107g)

gonna level with the 0.254 and slather on the glue

ey.69.mollog-holder.1d2h44m.126g

ocotprint says it's too big, but, tried it when i said "DOIT"

the results seem fine

...

some cosmetic peeling on the front-right which might be a first.

i'll do future longbois at a "backslash" angle

813g afterwards

1000 - 80 = 920

920 - 813 = 107

## ey.68.zarbags-cover.13h8m.63g (actual 80g including failures)

it this; https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/zarbags-gitz-warhammer-underworlds-storage

feels a bit wasteful to print this ... but ... the snapping cover should be good

it's aboiut Â£1.30 of materials

...

some way through it starte clicking

i adjusted by lowering the bed. looks fine.

i turned the nozzle up to 205 and the speed up to 110%

...

late night; the printer had fully clogged.
i think that the filament has worn thin - so - the drive isn't gripping it anymore.
i'll strip and clean it after work - here's hoping i don't have to cut the "white" ptfe tube with the blue tip i put in

...

strip was fast

restarted with 0.356mm slice

failed after 3.5 / 4 hours

had nozzle gunk

...

cleaned and leveld with 0.254mm they slathered glue on

finished fine ... i think ... there seems to be a weird tilt thing

consumed 80g of filament including failures

# [Eryone - 2](https://amzn.to/3vETX8s)

I bought a second spool of this stuff.


## ey.67-1.zarbags_resume.8h15m.34g

i used OpenSCAD to slice off the bottom and print the rest

new-Cura didn't "like" some of the overhangs ... but ... it worked out in the end.

it this; https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/zarbags-gitz-warhammer-underworlds-storage

i also want;

## ey.66.ZARBAGS_GITZ_holder.1d3h20m (soon)

i looked at doing it as thicker layer lines - but - that led to areas that'd need supports

with the 0.12 lines it needs no supports


...

first attepmt was peeling at the edges; restarted with hairspray and a slight tightening ... along with movign the curtain closer/snuger

...

a third attempt worked up until about 41mm where the printer threw up a "serial bus" error and just stopped

## ey.65.Hagglethorn-Homestead-Base-v1.4 (reprint - current)

ey.60 was the last "fine" one so ... let's go

i'm reprinting the bottom for an existing model

i've got all the models up to date

...

calibrated with .106 knife measure

...

print failed; nozzle was blocked.

i stripped the nozzle, clipped the tube and re-tried

...

it failed again and i stripped the nozzle fully - no visable leakage

when i clipped the tube this time, i put about 2cm of "blue tube" in the throat such that if it gets another "heat swelling" i can try to *just* replace the small tube instead of continually shortening the main bowden tube

it's been on for 15h08m and ... it fine?

i used hairspray!

## ey.64?.rough-stone-tile (???)

my scaling stuff keeps evapurating? maybe i'm saving/loading the wrong file?

## ey.63.Hagglethorn-Tower-Base-Supports-v1.2 (complete)

ey.63.Hagglethorn-Tower-Base-Supports-v1.2

- nozzle to 195
	- this is the cura profile for eryone
- ironing
	- this was sugested for uinrelated reasons on an unfrent print so i want to see what do
	- using concentric pattern
	- have to iron all the time - ionly toipo layer no good
- later bed to 55
	- i suspect this will make it work?

neat;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzW45MphcK4
nahh;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9otlFHhmZkY

...

after 3h15m seems still fine

...

at around 4 hours - it started peeling

the rest of the print finished fine, but, the one edge that peeled vexes me greatly

the ironing gave everything a flat and stupid finish; i'm not in love at all

also of note (and quite distressing) the pegs to attach the two pieces didn't print - i'm a bit worried wither that was ironging or the printer jamming after ironing that whole top layer

## ey.62.Hagglethorn-Tower-Base-Supports-v1.2 (FAILED)

next int he serries - done with normal ey.60 settings

- inital layer flow 85% -> 80%; reduce clicking?
	- it was only happening at the start
	- i assume that the first few layers were causing backpressure
		- ... and that the non-thick followups didn't cause same proiblem
		- ... or that the later layers had interior gaps where the presure could overlfow
- brim width 4->3 ; save filament?
- brim distance 0.6->0.5; save filament?

...

leveld with the card; no good

aboted - bad adheasion

...

eleveled with the wine coupon folder, and, put down glue stick

aborted - nozzle jammed

...

leveled with card

aborted - adhesion (possibly on unglued area) failed and peeled

...

washed bed

leveled by eye

hairspray

doing fine after 1h22m though

failed - i'm reslicing

## ey.61.rough-stone-tile (failed)

i'm trying the eryone filamet profile

i've rotated the tile 45 to try and deal with the elevation lines on it

i've also enabled normal supports in Cura

... a "better" solution ... might be to split it like a sandwich before printing; all angles would be at 45, right?

no ... no thjat won't do it since the insides will have islands

i'll scale up tp 32mm tiles (the design is 25.4) 32/25.4 = 1.25984251969 = 126%

upscaled to 32|?45|8h39|28g|9.35
started at 25.4|?45|4h40|16g|5.24
126x126x70|y+45|5h28|20g|6.65
126x126x60|y+45|4h28m|15g|5.11

i calibrated with the bugman's card

126x126x70|y+45|5h28m|20g|6.65

...

failed once - tried again levleing with wine coupon


...

failed again - worked ebtter though?

seemed to "fail in mid air"

- maybe steeper?

## ey.60.Hagglethorn-Tower-v1.3

floor 3 and top floor of lighthouse were the last "good" ey prints

... and the haggle mini ... i guess

reinstall/update Cura ... later

ey26?

temps are 200/60 across the board and iv;'e got the first layer thing going

ey26 looks ... fine ... but; i'm doing "sharpest corner z-alighn" 

... and "alternate extra wall"

going to do the "Hagglethor Tower" as it's the next part that'll stand alone

...

i levels with the wine recipt folder over - then - i put gluestick on the bed

the first 2/3/4 layers had clicks i started running it at 90%

later, durring layers with infill; that seemed to go away

## ey.59 / aq.54.paint-carousel.tray

There were adhesion and nerding problems.
I'm starting to think that I should tune to a brand and stick with it.

...

weird; looking back this doesn't have the settings ie expected.

## ey.58.Hagglethorn-Homestead-Roof-v1.6

I'm starting from [design 53](#aq-53-lighthouse-base-b-60) but not bothering with weighing everything.
I'm going to forgo supports and use the/a pre-supported file.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/Openlock/posts/1259185271224175/

i've lowered the speed from 45 to 40 (default is 50)

|ey.58.Hagglethorn-Homestead-Roof-v1.6   |2d16h43m|173g|57.98m| --- | --- |


...

There seems to be a lot of nerding ... maybe even some under-extrusion on one of the details.


# [AnyCubic](https://amzn.to/3vHENzy)

AnyCubic is a brand that I recognise and was on sale when I was running out.
It still seems to be on sale ... but ... I'm unsure if I want to buy more of it.
It's been an "indecipherably nicer" experince than the basic filament I consider a baseline, but, I'm not sure if that's down to my understanding of 3D printing or any actual product quality.

I worry that the filament needed a higher temperature which led to heat-creep.

## aq.57.shaker-one

let's see ... 

i'm trying an "all in one" shaker structure - not sure about it.
saved the file as my "strong" settings.
can't weigh the filament due to the tension in the coil messing up results.
measuring "loops" instead since it's all i can get.

...

it worked, but, it looks flimy as heck

i'll go with epoxy and a saw blade

## aq.56.jigsaw-blade2

just revised one

the shape is good/better/fine but i'm starting to wonder if I can/should *just* print the whole shaker.

## aq.55.jigsaw-blade

I need a new "jigsaw attachment" for my paint shaker.
There is a blade that I will use for attachment.
I have modeled an approximation of the blade and will print it.
I expected it'll be a "good" print for the last of the filamment.

|aq.55.jigsaw-blade|15m|2g|0.54| --- | --- |

The project file is in hg - unusual but this one isn't crazy big so it seemed like a good idea.

...

The "neck" seemed too long by 2mm and the nect was too wide by 0.5mm.




## aq.54.paint-carousel.tray

Thing Link; https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2436687

I have a small amount of filament left on the roll - so I chose to print something small; another tray for the paint racks that I use.
This came out perfectly - no skipping and smooth.
[I now have quite a collection of these little guys ... but it's never enough.](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:977602)

The total spool weighs between 160g and 172g left - the struggle is that the tension from the coiled filament pushes down on the scale when I weigh it.
The spool itself weighs 138g so I might have enough filament left to do another one of these ... especially if I "scrap load" it or "hot swap" some older lengths of material mid-print.

## aq.53.lighthouse-base-b.60

These were the final pieces of the lighthouse.
I didn't use any supports on it, and, I kept the "scale down" at 60%.
While I do adore the results of all three pieces ... I'm sad that I lost the "tilt" that was there.

When I started there was 237g of weight on the spool.
Cura thought that it was a 57g print - so that's good as long as it works.
At some point early in the print I heard skipping - I don't remember how many layers in I was.
I was able to "help it through" and the skipping seemed to stop - I *should* pull apart the hot-end and check, but, I don't want to.

> I think that I've developed a "fear" that anytime I take the machine apart, the next print/s will fail.
> This likely stems from the fact that I only take the machine apart when it's already failing.
> This is something that I would/should overcome with CBT - but ... I don't want to deal with it.

I've heard the word that an "all-metal motor" can fix skipping.
The justification is that the metallic parts last longer - so must be better.
My engineer brain doubts that this is true.
The parts involved in skipping are the gears that press the filament through and the motor that spins those gears.
The motor and gears are already metal - so wouldn't be affected by an all-metal-motor upgrade.
The all-metal upgrade would use the same motor as well.
I also reject the "what's the harm" argument - replacing these parts would require recalibrating the machine.
I would rather not recalibrate the machine.

## aq.50 (failure - clogjam)

start with aq.49 but
- temps to 200
- retraction halved to 2.5
- retraction slowed to 35 (was 45)
- flow as normal
- z scale down to 60%

... temps were already at 200 ...

369g spool at start

|aq.50.lighthouse-base-a.trees60|19h56m|76g|25.32m|369g|

i wonder what it'd be like scaled up to 110? could i avoid supports?

...

it stopped again after the first layer


## aq.49 (failed)

i'll start with aq.48, but;
- decrease the inital layer flow to 50%
- increase overall temp to 205
- increase inital nozzle to 210

if i'm right about what's wrong; this should still be probelmatic, but, should reduce the jamming

the old spool weighs 376g right now

...

the printer is still skipping.

i "helped" it a bit and it seemed to mean the problem stop.

is there an upgrade to the ender motor?

...

not really; noboyd can really describe what the all-metal extruder does

... but i can reduce retraction

## aq.48 (failed)

i think that i have 235g left - the new spool weight 1150 and the curent one weighs 385g

the lighthouse has three sections a-b-c

a has the dock and seems to be about 92g

b and c seem to be about 160g together


a at 80% with overhang = 82g, but, the underhang looks icky
a at 80% with trees = 86g i guess
- but i should do support blockers for the pegs/slockets

|aq.48.lighthouse-base-a.trees   |23h42m      |86g |28.83m     |

started at 1700 so probably 1300 tomorrow

...

after a few hours, and still on the first few layers Gif clogged.

i suspect that my "super thick" initial layer is causing an issue, and, i should reduce the flow

prints with larger first layers complicate the issue by being slow to print leading to a buildup of swollen filament?

## aq.42.anvil-pair (success)

I should have checked reddit before doing work on the printer today.
I stripped the hot end and "burn out" the throat and nozzle.
I also trimmed toe bowden tube as there was filament stuck in it and sludge on it.
When I did the reassembly I tried to keep the throat as far out of the heater block as I could.

I also recorded myself doing all of this - so - YouTube it?

I spent a lot of time sizing the Hagglethorn stuff and preparing to print it at 40% size.
I also tried to get them print-as-one with filled interiors.

I was unable to get a time estimate that I liked, so, I've switched to some "Maker's Anvil" models.
Going forward; I intend to amass a collection of (properly shrunk) houses for future occaisions.

I also need/want to build a tool to mangle the files myself - but - need a way to do that.
OpenSCAD *would be* ideal, but, I kept "losing" the file(s) (somehow) and they didn't appear in the exports.
Let's try something with PureScript and AssImp. (somehow)

In hindsight; think that I can do what I want by;
- building the combined model in IceSL
- exporting the foot of the model on its own
- exporting the full model as well
- placing both of these on the same build plate at the same location
- performing the fill in on the foot-only model
- adding support trees ONLY to the "full" model

... also, these were some timings I recorded

|scale|slice|fill|tree|time  |mass|
|-----|-----|----|----|------|----|
|50%  |21s? |yes |no  |10h37m|37g |
|50%  |120s |yes |10% |14h9m |48g |
|45%  |120s?|yes |10% |11h9m |37g |
|40%  |120s?|yes |10% |8h51m |29g |
|40%  |90s  |no  |10% |10h2m |30g |


In the end - they printed with a lot of under extrusion, nerds and stringing.

|stock - no holes|133g  |44.64m|1d9h31m |

the partial model is harder it seems ... likely because of the weird garbage leftover.

not sure if fixering it's worth the effort.

... and i just found the "no holes" setting which does it for me and saves ~14% material

so it looks like "no holes" is the way to go for this

- barracks a supports
- tower (no cap or support)

pull temp down to 200

...


there was a clog/dribble stuck on the nozzle and the print could no proceed

looks like a drop of material blocked the nozzle and printing couldn't proceed?

if it happens again i'll assume it's the 200 not 205 temp and turn it up to 210

## aq.38.spray-frame-stronk (success)

using a fine-print and thicker walls should "fix" the problem I had

re-waxed the pad

didn't re-level

786g at start

came out fine - but - too much leftover glue meant that the pirnt was stuck to the plate

## aq.28.lighthouse.floor-3

Change the/my EYone for a fresh AnyCubic roll.
The new roll weighs 1150g.

i'm starting with the 26 file and printing the "large base a" hagglethorn model with 10% infil but otherwise "stock"

----

it took over six minutes to slice

looks like it will take 236g of the roll to print!

----

re-slicing with 4 infill steps

232g

and i can see lots of "floating" infill lines

---


gonna do 25% with 5 steps

|infill|steps|material|
|------|-----|--------|
| 10%  |2    |236g    |
| 10%  |4    |232g    |

| 15%  |0    |307g    |

### actual print

HEKK WITH THIS - i;m doing the next part of the lightouse

the lighthouse is incomplete - so - it makes sense to "finish" it

it's 110% tall with 10% infill and 2@5 infill

aq.28.lighthouse.floor-3


octopi says 35.46m

cura says 106g / 35.43m


....

okay ... but ... this is oddly not fitting?

HELLL! it's uniformed scaled - so i need to do a reprint

spool says 1064/1065

# [Eryone](https://amzn.to/3vETX8s)

This was the first ... "nice" filament I bought.
It's hard to describe or define why it was nice - it was nice.

## ey.27.haggle-mini-cottage


29cm by 5.4cm

5.4cm / .175 = 30.85714285714286
5.4 / .2 = 27

so ... average? 28.92857142857143

there are 28.9 "strands"

each strand is ... 29cm long, or 0.29m long

16.7m

there's about 40% of a third row ... ish ... so maybe 19.9m?

let's see how lighthouse floor 3 at 10% infill estimates

28g - lolnope


hagglethorn cottage scaled to 50% seems to be within budget


let's goooo

....


i should have queded these up for sequential printing so that any failure could be ignored





## ey.26.lighthouse.floor-3

i think that i've gone from 5 layers of filament left to 3.
i had an estimated 54 meters when i started this "lightouse" print.
i now have ... 33?
i'm going to print more of the lighthouse, but, based on what's left next decide wether to do paint carasouls.

|?|?|
|--|--|
|old calculation|54|
|new calculation|33|
|top floor|23.32|
|roof|12.81|
|calculated usage|21|
|estimated consumption|36.13|
|theoretical remaining|22.07|

the lighthouse floor pieces are notable different in size between 1 and 4.
stretching floor-4 by 10% (as usual) shows a usage of 22.21m.
stretching to 20% shows 23.70.
this is looking "really" tight - i think that there was some "play" in my estimates - but - i don't know how that worked out with these calulations.

so i need my number(s) to be under 22m if I want to be "safe" with this spool.
i began experimenting with usage estimates in Cura, as shown below.

tri-hex at 15% would work, but, i don't like that the lines are vertical only - so - i want to check ifcubic-sub-div would do it at that density

|stretch|pattern      |percent|usage |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|
| 0%    |cubic        |20%    |20.72 |
|20%    |cubic        |20%%   |23.70m|
|10%    |cubic        |20%    |22.21m|
|10%    |cubic sub div|20%    |25.31m|
|10%    |zig zag      |20%    |23.87m|
|10%    |tri-hex      |20%    |22.16m|
|10%    |tri-hex      |15%    |21.65m|
|10%    |cubic sub div|15%    |23.93m|
|10%    |cubic        |15%    |21.56m|

curious that "cubic" and "tri-hex" at 15% had transposed sub-meter amounts

...

after printing;

- something screwed up the z-axis and compressed the very top
	- either z-screw or a trapped cable
- there's NOW about 2 layers of filament left
	- 29cm circumfrence
	- 5.4cm "wide"


## ey.25.lighthouse.top-floor

let's see how this one works - done via octoprint

...

two hours in - i wish that i'd copied it to the SD card and pritned from there somehow

... also; i really kind of want a camera.

there's "like no" state for octoprint, so, i could probably get away with rebuilding the whole thing

...

this also printed fine


## ey.24.lighthouse.roof

i'm aprehenive about starting another "large" print witht he filament level(s) i have left

i shall/will start another "tray" for my paint-carasouls

... in theory tho - i should be setting up octo-print

...

i did some napkin estimates and came up with 54 meters of filament left - not enough 

i tried out a piece of hagglethorn - no good

i sized up some parts for the lighthous - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3706122 so i'm going to test the roof with no supports

i could strtech the building parts vertically to ease this ... i think that i will; a minor 10% makes the roof "easier"

## ey.23.heliox.bolts-x3

need replacement bolts for the mount arm thing

used my 95% .scad file, then, sclaed it down by 20%
- i should update these files at some point

did a new profile

lowest quality with 25% infill in a gyroid patter, 60c bed, 0.75m dist brim, 4 line wall

...

heyaoo

i think that it worked perfectly

let's try out the/a LED attachments?

... bored ... bored; i'll do something else ... maybe


## ey.22.ps.haggle.homestead

i want to print the base with reduced filament usage.

|culled-v2|no      |0.5 |145g|1d16h45m|

It looks like v1 can save about 30g and 6h30m of time - that's promising but the shape has a flaw so I can't use it.
I fixed the sape and cut out more areas - v2.
v2 is not much better, but, it's actually printable.
I'd like to develop a v3 by moving/shrinking the door-cube; it's too close to the "concave wall" since that looks like it's getting very close for comfort.

... and overhang was on THE WHOLE DAMN TIME.

... and it's more complicated that way ... but at least i know it was good to get fixed.


i'm going to print it/this one as "stock" for this run.
i'd preffer something faster, but, this lets me (maybe) have the print ready Sunday with no more work now-now.

need to check;
- bed temp
	- already fine
- base layer flow
	- turned down to 90%
- overhang
	- already off


here's the script thing https://gitlab.com/g-pechorin/hagglethorn-mods


...

it worked out swell!

i should try the chopped version at some point

Okay - but - i'm going to print the roof of the cottage (asish) first.
I'd like to do some work to cut the middle out of the cottage with OpenSCAD and give out the .scad file.


i'm tweaking the infill numbers ... i'm looking at the "gradual infill" to use less infill in the bottom

used the 4mm brim and only on the outside (so the sockets will be safe?)

... oops ...

### ey.21-1.ps.haggle.cottage-roof

i had the overhang enabled - so i updated the previous table.
... and there was poor adhesion, and, i thought that there was some problem, but, i imagined that when i cancelled.

i also noticed that my "inital layer flow" isn't "speed" but volume?
i've turned that back.
i've switched the bed back up to 60c as well.

...

goodness that's skipping a lot ... and i'm on the first layer?
i think that the 90% was a good idea after all AND i should have levelled with paper.
here's hoping my baby get get throught he first layer (or two) fine.

## ey.20.ps.rampage-tile-stone

I've upped the brim distance to 0.6, but, noticed that the Overhang option was enabled.
I'm going to print a single clip to see what's what with the nozzle.
I'm also going to prep a single tile and I'll do that after if the clip works.

I'm going to lower the bed to 55 (out of fear) and use spray instead of stick.

|overhang|size|time |
|--------|----|-----|
|yes     |15g |3h33m|
|no      |13g |3h24m|

the final print was megastuck tot he bed

## ey.19.bsg-little-cottage.115.roof-v2 

i gave the plate a quick wipe, and, it felt taky so i skipped glue/clean and just levelled the bed

### results (attempt 1)

it adhered, but, around layer2 i realised "make overhang printable" was enabled which filled the underhang wasting material and time

### results (attempt 2)

|part|overhang|scale|layer|time|MASS|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|v2 roof | yes | 115% | 0.12 | 1 day 18 hours 35 minutes | 182g |
|v2 roof | overhang | 115% | 0.12 | 1 day 23 hours 15 minutes | 135g |


looks like the overhand shouldn't have been on ... but ... WtELF is with that time!?

... oh - and - the extruder was clogged.
i came back in and noticed the print had gotten stuck.

### results (attempt 3)

same `.stl` as 2 - but - i cleaned out the hot-end and switched to a new nozzle (on 2021-08-19)

RESULT; failure.

I used a combinator of hairspray and pritt as an experiemnt in adhesion ... and i think that's what didn't work.
I walked in to the sight of the stuff on the floor

![like a cat](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9OH0faWUAQF77x.jpg)

... also; the hot end is leaking.
based on where the dross is pooling (on the top) i suspect that the leak is between the throat and the block.
[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/aedwqv/hotend_leaking_on_ender_3/) seems to [suggest](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/asps1n/melted_filament_all_over_nozzle_after_print/) i should tighten the parts when the nozzle is empty and once 

![leak](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9OH0hiXIAA04zs.jpg)


i'm now deliberating on wether i want/need a torch for cleaning



[... also the upgrade video for couplers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn5g8Qf4h8o)

### results (attempt 4)

i replaced the bowden tube using ... old replacement tube

i replaced the couplers using ... spare couplers i already had

the razors i bought are for shaving and are smaller and floppier than i'd like

i leveled and re-glued the bed (noticing that the glue stick application seemed to "bump" the bed) and set her going


... to be continued ...

It looks like one of the corners is peeling.
I don't know if this is from too-little-glue or the curtains being drawn in the room.
I'll keep both factors in mind when I do the next print.

... more updates ...

It's still ... working.
It should be done some time on Monday.

I'm going to setup a "sequential" print of shrunken Hagglethorn stuff.

... then ...

it worked!
Gif was skipping a bit durring the end - I worry that I'll get the cover off and see a nozzle clog.
I noticed that the brim was much too close - I'll increase it from 0.4 to 0.6 and see how that goes.
There was/is no exterior leakage on Gif - so that's good so far.


## ey.18.bsg-little-cottage.115.base-no-inside

this will be "Black Scroll Games" model [Little Cottage (TabletopRPG house)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3621726) 

... well ... it'll be the "roof" part anyway ...

there are variations for this mode, but, i only want the simplest one


i'm assesing which guts i want

i will scale them to 115% (as suggested) for 32mm games


my printer is set to 0.12 which is a finer LOD than the author suggests

|part|scale|layer|time|MASS|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|scalabvle mergedd|100%|0.12|1 day 6 hours 17 minutes | 115g|
|no inside|100%|0.12|22 hours 12 minutes | 87g |
|merged v2 | 100%|0.12|2 days 9 hours 12 minutes | 257g |
|v2 roof | 100% | 0.12 | 1 day 6 hours 52 minutes | 126g |
|v2 roof | 100% | 0.2 | 22 hours 14 minutes | 136g |
|v2 roof | 115% | 0.12 | 1 day 18 hours 35 minutes | 182g |
|no inside|115%|0.12|1 day 4 hours 7 minutes | 114g |


i'll use the no-inside at 0.12 and 115%

i am worried about running out of filament, so, that's the "straw" in not doing the one with interiror

ey.18.bsg-little-cottage.115.base-no-inside

i've set it going around 10pm on Monday night

### results
it was done on Tuesday night (late)

it is mostly-perfect; the support teeth at the top are a bit naff, but, that's hardly an issue



## ey.17.tabletop-plant

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4070264

- as 16 otherwise
- level with a piece of paper
- bed at 60
- nozzle at 200
- i'm using a brin with a 1mm distance and 4mm width

### results

yeah - this one came out great

brilliant

i'm keeping these settings

still want the fancy tool (someday)

## ey.16.5-25-1-move-tray

copying advice (deleted) from reddit.

gonna do hotter nozzle, and, .38 first layer

- nozzle 210
- bed 65
- skirt 1mm
- layer1 thick .38
- layer1 flow 90%
- level with recipt

worked ebter, but, there's a weird separation between layer1 and layer2

print is usable - but - i want to change the design

## ey.15 feedback

- https://www.facebook.com/groups/Ender3dp/posts/756878821787122/

Advice Was;

- : a deleted comment advocating thicker "layer1" was AMAZING but successive layers didn't come out as well
- ; level with printer paper not recipt
  - contradicts earlier advice, but, the problem is still here (am applying it)
- ! don't print super-hot
	- contradicts earlier advice, but, the problem is still here (i might ignore)
- ? maybe another filament?
	- tempting to switch from the [ey]() once it's spent; eSun does a 3kg pack that's cheaper per unit
- ! don't use a gluestick that's why your prints (without gluestick) aren't sticking
	- again; this is contradictory
- ; use an car tool thing to level the bed
	- ahh; a precise replacement for the paper - yes



## ey.15.5-25-1-move-tray

should be a movement tray, but, am using a high accuracy thing and pritt stick for my sanity

looking at previous settings;
- build plate was way up
- print speed was 45 not 50
- print temp was normal
- tree supports and brim/skirt were things

| quality | time | cost |
|---|---|---|
| super (stock)| 3 hours 2 minutes | 13g |
| dynamic (stock) | 2 hours 16 minutes | 14g |
| standard (stock) | 1 hour 47 minutes | 13g |


i went for Super with *just* 65 plate - i'll use pritt

> ...

and it failed

horribly

looks like the print peeled away and the nozzle "cocooned"

### experiment

I'm posting the below on FaceBook and reddit to see which one gives useful advice.

```markdown
I've been trying to get back into this since ... June?
I haven't had a serious print that's adhered to the build plate ... which is unusual ...

I'm;

* levelling with a receipt
* washing with methylated spirits
* printing on glass
* putting the bed temperature at 65
* (now) using a pritt - brand glue stick\* as the hairspray wasn't working

The print peeled away from the bed during the first layer.
The nozzle isn't clogged
Anyone got any advice?

(\* yes, yes; I'm aware that using adhesives is "uncool" and I should use a glass bed instead. But. I'm doing that ... the glue stick can't hurt adhesion, right?)
