I have an old Unity project that I haven't looked at in awhile - [this one][mySpaceShips].
If memory serves; assembling a WebGL version is slow and boring - so I'm making my eager little Jenkins server do it.

Really I'm a bit bored with `sbt-launch` malarkey and I wanted to see if I could get this rolling.
Broadly the steps that I followed went like this;

1. Install Unity (5.3.3) with WebGL modules
	* 5.3.3's WebGL stuff has improved since I last checked
1. Build the whole tootin thing by hand (on your workstation)
	* This never works on the first try - better to do it locally
	* A custom build script was involved but many snags later **it lives!**
1. Validate WebGL player
	* `file://` isn't enough boyo; you need `http://` to play your game
	* ... actually ; [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) can open the local page as if it's [a real-boy](https://youtu.be/uEB45OAnixU)
		* ... y'know, this suggests some interesting options with desktop applications and Unity
1. Build by hand (again) on the CI server
	* I needed to reinstall Unity5.3.3 to get the trimmings I wanted
	* I also needed to make a build script `BB8ild` (script is below)
	* my CI server is slow so I wanted to iron out slow problems before I started picking at it here
	* still need to set it up for CI stuff
1. Configure Jenkins to assemble and post the project
 * This was more complex than I had anticipated
 * I needed to `cd` around and run a variety of tasks (script is below)
 * In the end - I cloned and pushed the whole site
	* ... and hoped for the best

# Jenkins Task

Some paths were changed for security-via-obscurity; this won't literally work but if run line-by-line and changed as you go you'll get there.

``` bash
cd mySpaceShips
/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity -batchmode -nographics -quit -executeMethod BB8ild.PerformBuild
cd build/
rm -dfr peter-lavalle.github.io/
hg clone git+ssh://git@github.com:peter-lavalle/peter-lavalle.github.io.git
rm -dfr peter-lavalle.github.io/assets/mySpaceShips/
mkdir -p peter-lavalle.github.io/assets/mySpaceShips/
mv ./web-gl/* ./peter-lavalle.github.io/assets/mySpaceShips
cd peter-lavalle.github.io/
hg add .
hg commit -m "$BUILD_TAG"
hg push
cd ..
rm -dfr peter-lavalle.github.io/
rm -dfr web-gl/
cd ..
rm -dfr build/
rm -dfr Library/
```

# Unity `BB8ild` build script

This'll work as-is

``` cs
using UnityEditor;

class BB8ild
{
	[MenuItem("Build/Build WebGL")]
	static void PerformBuild()
	{
		var sceneSettings = EditorBuildSettings.scenes;
		string[] scenePaths = new string[sceneSettings.Length];

		for (int i = 0; i < scenePaths.Length; ++i)
		{
			scenePaths[i] = sceneSettings[i].path;
		}
		BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer(scenePaths, "build/web-gl", BuildTarget.WebGL, BuildOptions.None);
	}
}
```
