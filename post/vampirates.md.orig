# 2020-10-20 / Skull Sail

Too loose to be a wing - it's a sail!

Ahoy!

# 2020-10-06 / Stinger and Chain

While this *would* suggest a Tyranid model with the armoured shell - Tyranids don't use chains.

It could be Slaanesh though.

# 2020-09-29 / Buzzard

Undead with buzzard is a nice fit, but, it's odd that they didn't choose a sea-birb.
I can't think of any faction that it would fit into, and, a parrot might look a bit out of place.

# 2020-09-22 / Peet on Thing

What is this thing that this peet is resting on?
The shading doesn't suggest fur, so; could be some "nosferatu" type of mutant vampire.

# 2020-09-15 / Dock Hook

Looks like a [bale-hook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(hand_tool)) for sure - that's only going to be by the sea!

The wrist looks far to small for a healthy living creature, and, the lack of ornamentation on the weapon and wrist dissuades be from thinking it's Chaos.

# 2020-09-09 / Saber

It's a sabre, possiblty a cutlass!
Any pirate should be please with such an ornate tool.

The wrist looks far to small for a healthy living creature, and, the lack of ornamentation on the weapon and wrist dissuades be from thinking it's Chaos.

# 2020-09-01 / Dual Hooks

Its a bit even for "Orks" and too complex for Orruks, but, it could be theirs.

It could also be an over developed [bale-hook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(hand_tool)).

Hard to tell about the hand holding it though.

# 2020-08-25 / Flintlock Pistol

It's a flintlock looking pistol.

It could be a new Freeguild sculpt, or something for the Skaven.

# 2020-08-18 / Wrist with Skull Gas

That wrist looks awfully wiry - ot's something undead and magical.

# 2020-08-11 / With Teeth

It's big with teeth and no hygeine.
Doesn't look like Orks, Tyranids or Chaos - I suspect an ancient beast brought back to life with vile sorcery.

# 2020-08-04 / Poleaxe

It's just a poleaxe ... but it's not in great shape ...

# 2020-07-28 / Crow and Key

It's a crow so I want it.
I'm not sure what it's up to ... but it looks displeased.

# 2020-07-14 / Drukhari Hair

There's a Drukhari hero with hair like this - and she's gone from the shop.

# 2020-06-23 / Skaven Furnace

It looks like a furnace that some Skaven might carry around ... or a mechanised shopboard monstraosity like a [Handyman](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Handyman_(Enemy)) or [Fireman](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Fireman).

# 2020-0519 / Sabre and Bracers

This looks ornate, possibly aelven.

... possibly ...

# 2020-05-12 / Bone Flute

I guess it wouldn't be pirates without doots!

# 2020-05-05 / Claw Hand on Hilt

WarHammer's Vampires descended from lords.
This could have once been a lord's sword, and that hand might have been a lord's ... once.

# 2020-04-21 / Crab Claw

Too weird to be fish-aelves, to sensible to be Chaos.

If it's VamPirates - we're getting some crabbos!
