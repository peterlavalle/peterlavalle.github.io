This is a followup to a [previous post](/post/pi3-dyndns/) because that one stopped working, now - this works.

There's not a lot of OC here, just clarity.

# NameCheap DynDNS on a Pi3

I use [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) (because they're anti-SOPA) for DNS.
The client program, [ddclient](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddclient/wiki/Home/), can connect to [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).

I'm using raspbian, so, first;

1. run `sudo apt-get install ddclient` on your Pi
1. find the dynamic DNS settings on NameCheap's website
	- **Dashboard** `>>>` **Domain List** `>>>` **Manage** `>>>` **Advanced DNS**
	- they do like to change these things around
1. halfway down the page, there should be a **DYNAMIC DNS** thingie
	- enable it (if you haven't already)
	- note the blurb-what-looks-like-a-SHA
1. edit your `/etc/ddclient.conf`to look like this

	```
		################
		# namecheap ddclient.conf
		# from https://blog.dembowski.net/2013/namecheap-dynamic-dns-setup-with-ddclient/
		################
		use=web, web=checkip.dyndns.com/, web-skip='IP Address'
		protocol=namecheap
		server=dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com
		login=your-domain-at-namecheap.whatnot
		password='blurb-what-looks-like-a-SHA'
		your-subdomain
	```

After rebooting my Pi (and giving any DNS caches time to flush) I could phone-home!

... but you can also see if the DNS records on [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)'s website have updated.
